Mini JavaScript Projects
======
A landing page for my mini JS projects. Simply click through each link to see a different example of my JavaScript.

I was inspired to do this on hearing about the 100 days of code challenge, to better myself in JS and
to amalgamate my projects into more ordered areas on my GitHub.

This is going to be continually updated as and when I complete a new mini project.
